- Leverage Redis pipelines and batching
- Compress large responses
- Monitor cache hit rates
- Scale with Redis clustering

**Cache Configuration Example:**
```python
import redis
import json
import hashlib

class LLMCache:
    def __init__(self):
        self.redis_client = redis.Redis(
            host='localhost',
            port=6379,
            decode_responses=True
        )
    
    def get_or_compute(self, prompt, compute_fn, ttl=3600):
        # Create cache key
        cache_key = f"llm:{hashlib.md5(prompt.encode()).hexdigest()}"
        
        # Check cache
        cached = self.redis_client.get(cache_key)
        if cached:
            return json.loads(cached)
        
        # Compute and cache
        result = compute_fn(prompt)
        self.redis_client.setex(
            cache_key, 
            ttl, 
            json.dumps(result)
        )
        return result
```
