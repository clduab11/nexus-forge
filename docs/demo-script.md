## 🎭 Act 1: Introduction & Problem Statement

### Opening Hook (30 seconds)
*[Screen: Nexus Forge landing page]*

**"Imagine describing your dream application in plain English and having it built, tested, and deployed in under 5 minutes. Not just a prototype—a complete, production-ready application with UI mockups, demo videos, and live deployment."**

*[Pause for effect]*

**"That's exactly what we've built with Nexus Forge."**

### The Challenge (45 seconds)
*[Screen: Traditional app development timeline graphic]*

**"Traditional app development takes weeks or months. Even with no-code tools, you're limited by templates and require technical knowledge. We asked ourselves: What if AI agents could work together like a software development team?"**

*[Screen: Nexus Forge architecture diagram]*

**"Meet Nexus Forge—where Starri, our master orchestrator, coordinates five cutting-edge AI models to transform your ideas into reality."**

### The Team (30 seconds)
*[Screen: AI model showcase]*

- **Starri**: Master orchestrator and project manager
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: Application architect with adaptive thinking  
- **Jules**: Autonomous full-stack developer
- **Veo 3**: Video prototyping specialist
- **Imagen 4**: UI/UX designer
