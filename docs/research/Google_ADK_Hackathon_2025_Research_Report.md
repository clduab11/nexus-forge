## 2. A2A (Agent-to-Agent) Protocol Technical Specifications

### Protocol Overview
The Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol is Google's open standard for enabling AI agents to communicate and collaborate across different frameworks, vendors, and platforms. Currently in open-source development with production release planned for late 2025.

### Core Architecture
- **Communication Model**: Two-agent system with "client" and "remote" agent roles
- **Protocol Foundation**: Built on HTTP, SSE (Server-Sent Events), and JSON-RPC standards
- **Security**: Enterprise-grade authentication, "secure by default" design
- **Modality Support**: Text, audio, video, forms, and bidirectional streaming

### Key Technical Components

#### Agent Card Discovery
- JSON-formatted capability advertisement
- Describes agent functions, supported modalities, and interaction preferences
- Enables dynamic agent discovery and capability matching

#### Communication Patterns
1. **Task Management**: Defined lifecycle for request completion
2. **Collaboration**: Context-aware message exchanges, artifact sharing, instruction coordination
3. **User Experience Negotiation**: Content type and format specification for optimal interaction

#### Protocol Specifications
- **Message Structure**: "Parts" with specified content types
- **Task Tracking**: Long-running task support with real-time feedback
- **Artifact Generation**: Structured output handling
- **Cross-Platform Interoperability**: Framework-agnostic communication

### Implementation Requirements
- GitHub repository: https://github.com/google-a2a/A2A
- Documentation: https://agent2agent.info/docs/introduction/
- Open-source community contributions welcomed
- Complements Model Context Protocol (MCP) for tool integration

### Industry Support
50+ partners including Atlassian, Box, Cohere, Intuit, Langchain, MongoDB, PayPal, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, and major consulting firms (Accenture, BCG, Deloitte, McKinsey, PwC).
